<p><b style="font-size: 24px; color: #FF5733;">Maristela Epino</b> is the second daughter of Meriam Epino and Antonio Epino. 
She is 20 years old, born on September 16, 2004, and currently live in Barangay Sta. Ana, Gubat, Sorsogon. She is a kind, 
friendly, and helpful person, but she can also be importunate and disobedient. She loves sweet foods, but dislikes spicy food. Maristela was born in Sta. Cruz, Manila and lived in Quezon City where she attended kinder garten and grade 1. Her mother only came home once a week, so her father took care of her and her younger sister. After finishing grade 1, her family decided to return to Bicol, where they continued her elementary education. They settled in Sta. Cruz, Barcelona, where her grandmother and her mother's sister lived. After a few days, her parents left her there to work in Manila. Maristela continued her schooling independently from grade 2 onwards. It was not easy since her aunt, who also had a child, was the one taking care of her. She experienced verbal abuse and harsh treatment, but she was too scared to tell her mother when she visited. After finishing grade 2, her father took her to live with her grandmother in Sta. Ana, Gubat, where she continued her education until grade 6. Her father was an alcoholic, and her mother was working in Manila, leaving Maristela to clean up after her father and endure his drunken episodes. She often stayed up late worrying and scared of her father's behavior. When Maristela graduated from high school, things improved slightly as her mother was now with her. She took entrance exams for Tourism at SSU and Criminology at SCCI. She preferred Criminology after being inspired by police officers who conducted seminars in their barangay about drugs and their effects. She wanted to become a police officer to help people. When the results were released, Maristela was very happy to see her name on the list of passers at SCCI. She no longer cared about passing at SSU because she was determined to study Criminology course. She was grateful for the opportunity her family provided her despite their financial struggles. She vowed to work hard in college to give her mother and sister a better life. She adored her mother, her ally and strength, and strived to succeed as a way of her mother's sacrifices.</p>
